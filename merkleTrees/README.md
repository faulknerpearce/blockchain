# **Merkle Tree Gift List Project**

## **Project Purpose**
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Merkle Trees** for data verification in a list. It showcases how to:
- Minimize server-side data storage by using a Merkle root.
- Validate whether a given name is in the "nice list" using proofs generated by a Merkle Tree.
- Efficiently verify data inclusion with cryptographic security.


### **Client**
This folder contains logic for generating proofs and sending requests to the server.

- **`main.js`**:
  - Generates a proof for a given name using the `MerkleTree` class.
  - Sends the name and proof to the server for verification.
  - Receives the server's response indicating whether the name is on the list.

### **Server**
This folder contains the server logic to verify proofs and respond to client requests.

- **`main.js`**:
  - Hosts an Express server.
  - Stores the Merkle root for the "nice list."
  - Verifies proofs received from the client using the `verifyProof` function.
  - Responds with success or failure messages based on proof validity.

### **Utils**
This folder contains utility files to construct and validate the Merkle Tree.

- **`MerkleTree.js`**:
  - Constructs a Merkle Tree from a list of names.
  - Provides methods to compute the Merkle root and generate proofs for specific names.
- **`niceList.json`**:
  - A predefined "nice list" of names, used as input to build the Merkle Tree.
- **`verifyProof.js`**:
  - Validates a Merkle proof for a given leaf and root.
  - Ensures the proof is correct and the leaf is part of the Merkle Tree.

## **How It Works**

### **1. Merkle Tree Construction**
The server uses the `niceList.json` file to construct a Merkle Tree and compute its root. This root is stored as a single 32-byte value, minimizing storage requirements.

### **2. Proof Generation**
The client uses the `MerkleTree` class to generate a cryptographic proof for a specific name in the list. The proof contains the necessary hashes to verify the name against the root.

### **3. Proof Verification**
The client sends the name and proof to the server. The server validates the proof using the stored root and responds with the result.


## **Setup and Usage**

### **1. Install Dependencies**
Run the following command in the root directory:
Run 'npm install'

### **2. Start the Server
Navigate to the server directory and start the server:
Run 'node index.js'

### **3. Run the Client
Navigate to the client directory and run the client:
Run 'node index.js'
