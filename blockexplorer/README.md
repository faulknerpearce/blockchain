# Ethereum Block Explorer

Block explorers give us the ability to view lots of different information about the blockchain including data about:
  * the blockchain network itself
  * blocks in the blockchain
  * transactions in a block
  * accounts
  * and many other things

## Getting Started
```shell
npm install
```

## 1. Create a unique Alchemy API key

If you have not already done so, create a unique Alchemy API Mainnet key
for your project as [described here](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/api-overview?a=eth-bootcamp).

## 2. Add your API key to as an environment variable for the project

Create an empty `.env` file in the base directory of this project.

Add the following line to the `.env` file replacing `YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` with your api key.

```sh
REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
```

Do not remove the `REACT_APP_` prefix. React uses that to import env variables.


## 3. Start the webserver

`npm start`

Running the command above will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The webpage will automatically reload when you make code changes.

What you'll see in the browser is Ethereum Mainnet's current block number. Not very exciting, but that's where you come in to save the day!
