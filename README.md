# Blockchain Projects

variety of blockchain and cryptography scripts intended for educational and demonstration purposes. 
These projects illustrate foundational concepts in cryptocurrency, secure digital signatures, and data integrity verification.

## Contents

### Asymmetric Cryptography
Scripts demonstrating the principles of asymmetric cryptography, including key pair generation, encryption, and verifcation.

### Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
Implementation of ECDSA, a widely used algorithm in blockchain technology for verifying the authenticity of transactions. 
Examples include key generation, signing messages, and verifying signatures to ensure message integrity.

### Python
All scripts are written in Python, 
leveraging libraries for cryptographic functions and demonstrating the integration of cryptographic algorithms into blockchain-based workflows.
